## Installation

Paste this into your Terminal and press Enter:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennymayo/ads-mcp-connector/main/install.sh | bash
```

> **What is a terminal?** On a Mac, press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter. On Windows, search for "Command Prompt". It's just a text-based way to talk to your computer — think of this command as downloading and installing the connector automatically.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.10 or newer ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — takes 3 min)
- One of the supported AI tools (see below)
- A Meta Ads and/or Google Ads account

The installer will:
- Download this connector to `~/ads-mcp-connector`
- Install Python dependencies automatically
- Auto-detect which AI tools you have and register with all of them
- Install a security hook that scans for API keys before every git commit

## Supported tools

| Tool | Works | Guided setup skill |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | ✓ | ✓ `/ads-connect` |
| [Claude Desktop / Cowork](https://claude.ai/download) | ✓ | ask in natural language |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com) | ✓ | ask in agent mode |
| Claude.ai (web) | ✗ | — |

The installer detects which tools you have installed and registers automatically with all of them. If you install a new tool later, just run `bash install.sh` again.

## Usage

**Claude Code** — open any project and type:
```
/ads-connect
```
The skill walks you through connecting your ad accounts step by step.

**Claude Desktop / Cowork** — restart after install, then just ask:
```
Connect my Meta Ads account
```

**Cursor** — restart after install, open agent mode, then ask:
```
Connect my ad accounts and show me last month's campaigns
```

Once connected, ask questions in plain English from any of these tools:

```
Show me my campaigns from last month

What search terms are triggering my Google Ads?

Compare Meta and Google spend this week

Break down my top campaign by age and gender

What's my ROAS across both platforms?
```

## What gets connected

### Meta Ads
- Campaign performance (spend, impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC)
- Ad set breakdowns (by age, gender, placement, device)
- Individual ad performance with creative details
- Account-level overview

### Google Ads
- Campaign performance (cost, clicks, conversions, ROAS)
- Keyword performance with Quality Scores
- Search term report — see exactly what searches triggered your ads
- Ad group breakdown

## How credentials are stored

Your API keys are stored in a `.env` file at `~/ads-mcp-connector/.env`. This file is:
- **Gitignored** — never committed to GitHub
- **Local only** — stays on your machine
- **Written by the skill** — you never need to edit it manually

The `/ads-connect` skill writes your credentials directly from Claude chat to the `.env` file. You paste a token in chat, the skill saves it securely — the full value is never echoed back.

### Credential lifespans

| Platform | Method | Expires |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Meta Ads | System User token (recommended) | Never |
| Meta Ads | Graph API Explorer token (fallback) | 60 days |
| Google Ads | OAuth2 refresh token | Never (unless revoked) |

---

## Security

Every commit to this repo is scanned automatically for exposed credentials.

If you accidentally paste an API key into a source file and try to commit it, the commit will be blocked with a plain-English explanation of what to do.

To run a manual scan:
```bash
python secrets_check.py
```

## Connecting to other tools

The MCP server exposes these tools to Claude Code. You can reference them directly in any Claude session:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `check_connection` | Test credentials for both platforms |
| `meta_get_campaigns` | List campaigns with performance data |
| `meta_get_ad_sets` | Ad sets with targeting and delivery |
| `meta_get_ads` | Individual ads with creative and metrics |
| `meta_get_account_overview` | Top-level account stats |
| `meta_get_insights` | Breakdown by age, gender, placement, device |
| `google_get_campaigns` | Campaigns with cost, conversions, ROAS |
| `google_get_keywords` | Keywords with Quality Score |
| `google_get_search_terms` | Actual searches triggering your ads |
| `google_get_account_overview` | Account-level ROAS and impression share |
| `google_get_ad_groups` | Ad group performance |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Claude Code doesn't recognize `/ads-connect`**
Run `bash ~/ads-mcp-connector/install.sh` again and restart Claude Code.

**Meta token expired**
Run `/ads-connect` — the skill detects expiration automatically and walks you through renewal (2 min). Avoid this entirely by using the System User setup path (token never expires).

**Google returns an auth error**
Your refresh token may have been revoked. Go to [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions), remove access for your app, then run `python get_google_token.py` to generate a new one.

**Pre-commit hook not running**
Run `bash install.sh` from inside the repo directory to reinstall it.
